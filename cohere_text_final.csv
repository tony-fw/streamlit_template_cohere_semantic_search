"['Humans speak over 71001 languages, yet the majority of language models only support the English language. This makes it incredibly challenging to build products and projects using multilingual language understanding. Cohereâ€™s mission is to solve that by empowering our developers with technology that possesses the power of language. Thatâ€™s why today weâ€™re introducing our first multilingual text understanding model that supports over 100 languages and delivers 3X better performance than existing open-source models. This will enable new markets, countries, and global companies to better serve their customers across the globe.', 'Multilingual text understanding models are powerful models that can derive insights from text data across languages. At Cohere, weâ€™ve trained our model specifically to be used for search, content aggregation and recommendation, and zero-shot cross-lingual text classification. ', 'While many of these models are available for English, similar existing multilingual models only work well for short sentences and canâ€™t capture the meaning behind longer text. This prevents them from being used for semantic search, which typically aims to match a short query with a longer, relevant document.', 'In this blog post, we will cover three relevant use cases that showcase the power of Cohereâ€™s new multilingual model:', 'Cohereâ€™s multilingual text understanding model maps text to a semantic vector space (also known as â€œembeddingsâ€), positioning texts with a similar meaning in close proximity. This process unlocks a range of valuable use cases for multilingual settings. For example, one can map a query to this vector space during a search to locate relevant documents nearby. This often yields search results that are several times better than keyword search.', 'To train multilingual models, you need large quantities (hundreds of millions) of suitable training pairs, like question/answer pairs. So far, such training data has been primarily available in English, and prior work tried to use machine translation to map it to other languages. However, these models donâ€™t capture the nuances behind language usage in different countries.', 'Contrary to this approach, we collected a dataset of nearly 1.4 billion question/answer pairs across tens of thousands of websites in hundreds of languages. These are questions actually asked by speakers of said languages, allowing us to capture language- and country-specific nuances.', 'So, today we are happy to release our first multilingual embeddings model: multilingual-22-12!', 'The multilingual-22-12 model can be used to semantically search within a single language, as well as across languages. Compared to keyword search, where you often need separate tokenizers and indices to handle different languages, the deployment of the multilingual model for search is trivial: no language-specific handling is needed â€” everything can be done by a single model within a single index. Weâ€™re extremely proud of the performance of our multilingual understanding model. It outperformed the industry standard (the next best model) in search tasks by more than 230%.', 'We extensively benchmarked our new model to ensure the best performance across a wide range of applications, domains and languages. Specifically, we used:', 'We compared our results against other state-of-the-art multilingual embedding models, specifically paraphrase-multilingual-mpnet-base-v2 (the best model from Sentence-Transformers), LaBSE (from Google), and Universal Sentence Encoder cMLM (from Google). The following chart shows how they compare:', 'The Cohere multilingual-22-12 model performs much better in all use cases. In particular, we see a robust improvement in multilingual search. The other models we tested against perform rather poorly, in many cases less effectively than keyword search. The main reason is that these models have just been trained at a sentence level, and they are not able to produce meaningful embeddings for longer text, like paragraphs.', 'Traditional keyword search has its limitations in that it often doesnâ€™t find the relevant information that matches the userâ€™s search intent. For instance, the simple search query, â€œWhat is the capital of the United States?â€ produced the following results:', 'To further exacerbate the problem, keyword search with Elasticsearch ranks an article about Capital Punishment at the top position, as it contains many instances of the words capital, united, and states. The second and third-ranked results are also not much better. These are articles about Ohio and Nevada, which are states in the United States and they also have a capital.', 'By contrast, search quality can be greatly improved by using semantic search powered by Cohereâ€™s multilingual model. In this example, the relevant article about Washington, D.C., is ranked at the top position of the search results. And such a gain in search quality is found not only with English queries, but also for a wide range of languages that we have tested (see benchmark results).', 'Semantic search does not restrict itself to queries and documents in the same language, but it also works across languages. For example, if we phrase the search query in Arabic (â€œÙ…Ø§ Ù‡ÙŠ Ø¹Ø§ØµÙ…Ø© Ø§Ù„ÙˆÙ„Ø§ÙŠØ§Øª Ø§Ù„Ù…ØªØ­Ø¯Ø©ØŸâ€), we get the same results, while keyword search can obviously not retrieve any relevant documents.', 'The multilingual flexibility of semantic search enables interesting use cases in industries like finance, where users need to quickly find information that may be published across multiple languages.', 'When successful products like the iPhone launch, tens of thousands of users around the world post their feedback (in their own language) on eCommerce sites, social media, blogs, and elsewhere. Extracting insights from these reviews enables companies to quickly respond to the market, better understand their customer base, and improve their product roadmap. ', 'However, previous methods for content aggregation have only worked well for English, and they didnâ€™t allow users to see patterns across languages or to compare feedback from different markets.', 'Cohereâ€™s multilingual model maps text in different languages to the same vector spaces, allowing users to derive insights across languages and find patterns for specific markets (e.g., which markets care about the picture quality of smartphones).', 'Using thousands of commands directed at a digital assistant, we created a representation demo and video to demonstrate how you can visualize and pull insights from multilingual customer feedback.', 'In todayâ€™s world, content moderation remains a major challenge. Social platforms like online gaming are attracting a wider international audience, which increases the complexity of content moderation efforts. As hateful content makes its way across multiple languages, it has a greater probability of passing through current content moderation tools that only catch English comments.', 'To tackle this challenge, platforms can now use Cohereâ€™s multilingual embeddings model to build a content moderation tool that works across 100+ languages and only requires training data in English.', 'For the content moderation use case, the model just needs a handful of training examples in one language that demonstrate harmful and acceptable content. Developers can then train a classifier (in English or a language of their choice) to find the decision boundary in the vector space that helps determine which type of content â€” in 100+ languages â€” is undesirable on their platform.', 'The following demo showcases Cohereâ€™s multilingual model used to build a recommendation movie engine and obtain relevant results regardless of the language used in the search query or the content source. In addition, it demonstrates multilingual sentiment analysis classification across a wide variety of languages', 'Test out the multilingual search and recommendation demo, multilingual sentiment analysis classification demo, and watch a demonstration:', 'To get started using Cohereâ€™s multilingual model, just create a free account and get your API key. You can then either query our REST API endpoints or install our SDK to use the model within Python. ', 'The following video navigates through the Cohere Platform to select the multilingual model, and shows how the multilingual model can embed text from multiple languages into the embedding space.', 'Additionally, we have added to the Cohere Sandbox, a collection of experimental, open-source GitHub repositories \xa0that make building applications using large language models fast and easy with Cohere. You can find an example of how to use the Cohere API to build a multilingual semantic search engine. The search algorithm used in this project is fairly simple: it finds the paragraph which most closely matches the representation of the question using the co.embed endpoint.', 'Training embedding models require data in a specific format. For example, question/answer pairs or title/document pairs. We can then learn which text pairs should be closer together in the vector space in order to enable applications like semantic search.', 'To train Cohereâ€™s new multilingual model, we processed and carefully cleaned terabytes of data from various sources: Wikipedia, news publications, scientific articles, and online communities across hundreds of languages. This resulted in a large training corpus of more than 900 million training pairs for English and 450 million training pairs for other languages. ', 'Other multilingual embedding models often rely on machine translation for training dataset creation, which creates an awkward bias for these models. A lot of existing English training data has a focus on topics that are primarily interesting for U.S. citizens, for example, how to fill out specific U.S. tax forms. If these question/answer pairs are then translated into another language, e.g., Korean, the model learns in Korean how to file taxes in the U.S., but it doesnâ€™t learn how to file taxes in Korea, a topic that is likely more relevant for Korean citizens. This makes prior models rather suboptimal for multilingual semantic search, as they donâ€™t capture country-specific interests well. ', 'Our training process included actual authentic question/answer pairs from users across hundreds of languages from tens of thousands of websites from hundreds of countries. This is what makes the Cohere multilingual model so powerful: it has seen thousands of topics in each language.', 'At Cohere, we are committed to breaking down barriers and expanding access to cutting-edge NLP technologies that power projects across the globe. By making our innovative multilingual language model available to all developers, we continue to move toward our goal of empowering developers, researchers, and innovators with state-of-the-art NLP technologies that push the boundaries of language AI.', 'Sign up and try our new multilingual model for free.

We can then learn which text pairs should be closer together in the vector space in order to enable applications like semantic search.', 'To train Cohereâ€™s new multilingual model, we processed and carefully cleaned terabytes of data from various sources: Wikipedia, news publications, scientific articles, and online communities across hundreds of languages. This resulted in a large training corpus of more than 900 million training pairs for English and 450 million training pairs for other languages. ', 'Other multilingual embedding models often rely on machine translation for training dataset creation, which creates an awkward bias for these models. A lot of existing English training data has a focus on topics that are primarily interesting for U.S. citizens, for example, how to fill out specific U.S. tax forms. If these question/answer pairs are then translated into another language, e.g., Korean, the model learns in Korean how to file taxes in the U.S., but it doesnâ€™t learn how to file taxes in Korea, a topic that is likely more relevant for Korean citizens. This makes prior models rather suboptimal for multilingual semantic search, as they donâ€™t capture country-specific interests well. ', 'Our training process included actual authentic question/answer pairs from users across hundreds of languages from tens of thousands of websites from hundreds of countries. This is what makes the Cohere multilingual model so powerful: it has seen thousands of topics in each language.', 'At Cohere, we are committed to breaking down barriers and expanding access to cutting-edge NLP technologies that power projects across the globe. By making our innovative multilingual language model available to all developers, we continue to move toward our goal of empowering developers, researchers, and innovators with state-of-the-art NLP technologies that push the boundaries of language AI.', 'Sign up and try our new multilingual model for free.

A menu of saved prompts, or presets, is shown in the left-hand pane, and model parameter controls are located in the right-hand pane.', 'Weâ€™ll cover presets and parameters later in this article, but now, letâ€™s start with the fun part: prompt design.', 'Prompting is at the heart of working with LLMs. The prompt provides a context for the text that we want the model to generate. The prompts we create can be anything from simple instructions to more complex pieces of text, and they are used to encourage the model to produce a specific type of output. ', 'Coming up with a good prompt is a bit of both science and art. On the one hand, we know the broad patterns that enable us to construct a prompt that will generate the output that we want.

But this type of prompt is rather open-ended, and in more practical applications, you will need to make the prompt tighter, so that the output generated will be more predictable.', 'With that, letâ€™s now dive into how you can design more effective prompts.', 'How a prompt is designed is dependent on the type of model you are using. There are two types of generative models available on the Cohere Platform: one where you prompt by instruction and another where you prompt by example.', 'In summary, this is how the two types of models differ:', 'Prompting by Instruction', 'Prompting by Example', 'Now letâ€™s learn more about designing these two types of prompts.', 'The Command-Xlarge model works best when we provide an instruction-based prompt. One way to do this is by using imperative verbs to tell the model what to do, for example: generate, write, list, provide, and other variations.', 'Letâ€™s say that we are creating social media ad copy for a wireless earbuds product. We can write the prompt as follows.\nGenerate a social ad copy for the product: Wireless Earbuds.', 'At this point, ensure that you select command-xlarge in the MODEL dropdown in the right pane. Then, click on Generate.', 'This generates the following output.', 'Thatâ€™s not bad. With a simple, one-line prompt, we already have a piece of ad copy that will make a digital marketer proud!', 'But perhaps we want to be more specific in terms of what we want the output to look like. For this, we can layer additional instructions onto the model in the prompt.', 'Letâ€™s say that we want the model to provide the ad copy in the form of a wellâ€“known copywriting technique, called the AIDA Framework (which stands for Attention, Interest, Desire, and Action). In this case, we can append this specific instruction in the prompt as follows.', 'Generate an ad copy for the product: Wireless Earbuds. The copy consists of four parts (Attention, Interest, Desire, Action), following the AIDA Framework.', 'The model picks up what the AIDA Framework is, and duly returns an output following the format that we wanted. Wonderful!', 'The prompt can be constructed as a combination of an instruction and some context. Letâ€™s see this in action with another example: emails. We can create a simple instruction to write an email as follows.', 'Or we can create an instruction to summarize an email, and that email now becomes part of the prompt, acting as the context.', 'This is just a taste of what kinds of prompts you can design. You can keep layering your instructions to be as specific as you want, and see the output generated by the model. And there is really no right or wrong way to design a prompt. Itâ€™s really about applying an idea and continuing to iterate the prompt until you get the outcome you are looking for.', 'Sometimes you want the model output to be more attuned to a specific pattern or nuance that you have in mind. For this, a better option might be to use the XLarge or Medium model and prompt it by example instead of by instruction.', 'For example, say you want to generate product descriptions for a long list of products. You want each of the descriptions to be of similar length. And for each product description, you want to be able to input a few keywords to guide the content of the descriptions.

If you want the output to be more elaborate, or as a list, or in any format, what you need to do is to alter your examples, and the model will duly return similar outputs.', 'Letâ€™s take another example. This one is for generating haikus, a type of short-form poetry originally from Japan. Say we want the haiku to be precisely three lines, each with a similar length. The Command-XLarge model might still work for this, but over many generations, the output format could vary. This is where we can use the XLarge model to provide examples of the type of output we want.', 'Hereâ€™s what the prompt looks like, where we give a few haiku examples:', 'And this is what the output looks like:', 'Perfect, just as we want it!', 'Other than the prompt design, there is another way to control the kind of output we want, that is, by adjusting the model parameters. These parameters are available on the right pane of the Playground. They are applicable to both types of prompting we discussed earlier.', 'Letâ€™s now see what we can do with these parameters.', 'There are a couple of parameters that let you decide when the model should stop.', 'Probably the most useful set of parameters are the ones that we can tune to control the randomness of the output. The beauty of working with LLMs is, for the same prompt, the next generated token will not be the same every time. Rather, it is sampled from a long list of possible tokens. This is where the creative aspect of LLM comes from, allowing us to generate a variety of outputs, given the exact same prompt.', 'But depending on your application, you may want to reduce, or increase, this level of randomness. You can do this by adjusting a number of parameters.', 'But before looking at the parameters, itâ€™s worth taking the time to understand how the model selects the next token to generate. It does this by assigning a likelihood number to each of all possible next tokens. The model would see that the token cookies has a much higher likelihood than chair for appearing after the phrase I like to bake.', 'During text generation, thereâ€™s still a probability that chair would appear, but the probability is much lower than cookies. The parameters we are going to see now can change this behavior.', 'There are three parameters we can adjust for this.', 'Two parameters allow you to control the amount of repetition in the generated text.', 'You can save the prompts that you have created by clicking on the Save button on the bottom right of the Playground.

We want to enable developers to add language AI to their technology stack and build impactful applications with it.', 'In this multi-part guide, we will go through everything that you need to know about generative AI with Cohereâ€™s large language models (LLMs).', 'Here is what weâ€™ll cover throughout this series:', 'In this Part 1 article, we will cover the following topics:', 'Throughout the series, we will cover the full spectrum of working with generative AI to enable you to build applications with it. But to start with, letâ€™s take the no-code route: weâ€™ll show you how AI text generation works, and how you can experiment with it in the Cohere Playground.', 'First, sign up for a Cohere account and then visit the Playground.', 'The Playground UI consists of a few sections. The main window is where you enter your prompt and where the output, or response, is generated. A menu of saved prompts, or presets, is shown in the left-hand pane, and model parameter controls are located in the right-hand pane.', 'Weâ€™ll cover presets and parameters later in this article, but now, letâ€™s start with the fun part: prompt design.', 'Prompting is at the heart of working with LLMs. The prompt provides a context for the text that we want the model to generate. The prompts we create can be anything from simple instructions to more complex pieces of text, and they are used to encourage the model to produce a specific type of output. ', 'Coming up with a good prompt is a bit of both science and art. On the one hand, we know the broad patterns that enable us to construct a prompt that will generate the output that we want. But on the other hand, there is so much room for creativity and imagination in coming up with prompts that can get the best out of a model.', 'To understand how model prompting works, letâ€™s start by entering the following prompt into the playground.', 'Once upon a time in a magical land called', 'Clicking Generate gives us a continuation of the text (model-generated text is in bold).', 'This is the most basic form of prompting, which is simply asking the model to complete the text that we have entered. But this type of prompt is rather open-ended, and in more practical applications, you will need to make the prompt tighter, so that the output generated will be more predictable.', 'With that, letâ€™s now dive into how you can design more effective prompts.', 'How a prompt is designed is dependent on the type of model you are using. There are two types of generative models available on the Cohere Platform: one where you prompt by instruction and another where you prompt by example.', 'In summary, this is how the two types of models differ:', 'Prompting by Instruction', 'Prompting by Example', 'Now letâ€™s learn more about designing these two types of prompts.', 'The Command-Xlarge model works best when we provide an instruction-based prompt. One way to do this is by using imperative verbs to tell the model what to do, for example: generate, write, list, provide, and other variations.', 'Letâ€™s say that we are creating social media ad copy for a wireless earbuds product. We can write the prompt as follows.\nGenerate a social ad copy for the product: Wireless Earbuds.', 'At this point, ensure that you select command-xlarge in the MODEL dropdown in the right pane. Then, click on Generate.', 'This generates the following output.', 'Thatâ€™s not bad. With a simple, one-line prompt, we already have a piece of ad copy that will make a digital marketer proud!', 'But perhaps we want to be more specific in terms of what we want the output to look like. For this, we can layer additional instructions onto the model in the prompt.', 'Letâ€™s say that we want the model to provide the ad copy in the form of a wellâ€“known copywriting technique, called the AIDA Framework (which stands for Attention, Interest, Desire, and Action). In this case, we can append this specific instruction in the prompt as follows.', 'Generate an ad copy for the product: Wireless Earbuds. The copy consists of four parts (Attention, Interest, Desire, Action), following the AIDA Framework.', 'The model picks up what the AIDA Framework is, and duly returns an output following the format that we wanted. Wonderful!', 'The prompt can be constructed as a combination of an instruction and some context. Letâ€™s see this in action with another example: emails. We can create a simple instruction to write an email as follows.', 'Or we can create an instruction to summarize an email, and that email now becomes part of the prompt, acting as the context.', 'This is just a taste of what kinds of prompts you can design. You can keep layering your instructions to be as specific as you want, and see the output generated by the model. And there is really no right or wrong way to design a prompt. Itâ€™s really about applying an idea and continuing to iterate the prompt until you get the outcome you are looking for.', 'Sometimes you want the model output to be more attuned to a specific pattern or nuance that you have in mind. For this, a better option might be to use the XLarge or Medium model and prompt it by example instead of by instruction.', 'For example, say you want to generate product descriptions for a long list of products. You want each of the descriptions to be of similar length. And for each product description, you want to be able to input a few keywords to guide the content of the descriptions. ', 'A basic prompt format that generally works well is as follows.', 'With our product description case, hereâ€™s what the prompt looks like:', 'At this point, ensure that you select xlarge or medium in the MODEL dropdown in the right pane.', 'And this is what the output looks like:', 'Notice that since the examples we provided were concise, the model generated one with a style for this new product. If you want the output to be more elaborate, or as a list, or in any format, what you need to do is to alter your examples, and the model will duly return similar outputs.', 'Letâ€™s take another example. This one is for generating haikus, a type of short-form poetry originally from Japan. Say we want the haiku to be precisely three lines, each with a similar length. The Command-XLarge model might still work for this, but over many generations, the output format could vary. This is where we can use the XLarge model to provide examples of the type of output we want.', 'Hereâ€™s what the prompt looks like, where we give a few haiku examples:', 'And this is what the output looks like:', 'Perfect, just as we want it!', 'Other than the prompt design, there is another way to control the kind of output we want, that is, by adjusting the model parameters. These parameters are available on the right pane of the Playground. They are applicable to both types of prompting we discussed earlier.', 'Letâ€™s now see what we can do with these parameters.', 'There are a couple of parameters that let you decide when the model should stop.', 'Probably the most useful set of parameters are the ones that we can tune to control the randomness of the output. The beauty of working with LLMs is, for the same prompt, the next generated token will not be the same every time. Rather, it is sampled from a long list of possible tokens. This is where the creative aspect of LLM comes from, allowing us to generate a variety of outputs, given the exact same prompt.', 'But depending on your application, you may want to reduce, or increase, this level of randomness. You can do this by adjusting a number of parameters.', 'But before looking at the parameters, itâ€™s worth taking the time to understand how the model selects the next token to generate. It does this by assigning a likelihood number to each of all possible next tokens. The model would see that the token cookies has a much higher likelihood than chair for appearing after the phrase I like to bake.', 'During text generation, thereâ€™s still a probability that chair would appear, but the probability is much lower than cookies. The parameters we are going to see now can change this behavior.', 'There are three parameters we can adjust for this.', 'Two parameters allow you to control the amount of repetition in the generated text.', 'You can save the prompts that you have created by clicking on the Save button on the bottom right of the Playground. Once you have saved a prompt, it will appear as a preset on the Playgroundâ€™s left pane.', 'You can also share these prompts with others. To do this, click on the Share button on the top right of the Playground. You will get a link which you can share with anyone!', 'In this article, we covered how to prompt a model â€” probably the most important, and definitely the most fun part of working with large language models. If youâ€™d like to dive deeper into it, here are some resources you can go to for further reading:', 'In the coming Part 2, we will explore the range of use cases and areas where generative AI in language can be applied.

One common solution is to use intrinsic rewards to encourage agents to explore their environment.

Instead, we explore natural language as a general medium for highlighting relevant abstractions in an environment.

"['In this talk, Dr. Rachael Tatman introduced us to Cohere LLMs and walked us through the reasons behind using them for data augmentation. She explained several strategies and the problems that we may face while augmenting our models. She also offered advice and recommendations for performing data augmentation with a focus on data diversity while also demonstrating a few examples using the Cohere LLM and how it gives us a warm start for our models. ', 'This articleâ€™s title and TL;DR have been generated with Cohere.Get started with text generation', 'Discover some tips and techniques for creating chatbots with LLMs. In this video, Rachael Tatman, a language technology educator, offers some advice and ideas for developing chatbots with LLMs. She details the what, why, and how of data augmentation while illustrating how we may validate the created data and add diversity to our data. One of her goals is for everyone interested in NLP to be able to build reliable, useful language technology tools that genuinely improve peopleâ€™s lives.', 'Dr. Rachael Tatman started her talk by strongly advising against serving raw-generated text to users for both UX and security reasons because of its unpredictability. She also mentions that most of the adversarial attacks on the LLMs require access to raw text output. So, if we donâ€™t release the raw data, we wonâ€™t have to deal with adversarial attacks. She recommends human-in-the-loop data augmentation for a warmer start when training or fine-tuning a chatbot.', 'Data augmentation is beneficial when we donâ€™t have representative data for all our targeted user personas. She also states that data augmentation is fruitful when we have representative data, but there are missing examples for specific intents. For instance, it happens when a new topic suddenly becomes relevant. In addition, data augmentation is crucial when working with some research data that is typically very clean and does not represent user-generated text.', 'We can avoid repetition and unintended errors by using LLMs over other techniques like templatic-rule-based data augmentation. Besides, the templatic-rule-based approach lags in generating data with different syntax. She also says that LLMs are more efficient than other translation-based approaches that are usually full of errors. In addition to that, using LLMs is a faster, cheaper, and more reliable approach than generating all new data. ', 'While LLMs also represent noisy user-generated textâ€“so, while training our model, it will undoubtedly benefit from such a diverse range of data.', 'Cohereâ€™s Generation Large Language Model is trained on the Google Books dataset, CommonCrawl, and other text from the internet scraped by the Cohere infrastructure team [see: Generation Model Card]. The top ten domains scraped by the infrastructure team at Cohere include: wordpress.com, medium.com, stackexchange.com, tumblr.com, elsevier.com, genius.com, bbc.co.uk, libsyn.com, yahoo.com, nytimes.com. Based on this, Cohere LLMs have used various data to train the model, including noisy data. ', 'Now, depending on your specific case, you may have variations in what you actually choose to do, but here are some recommendations.', 'Itâ€™s recommended to work with the data you have and use that to train the model using prompt engineering to generate new data. In this example, Dr. Tatman walks us through an example she created by using the SLURP dataset (Bastianelli et al. 2020). She takes this data because it is very clean and fairly formal. ', ""Example: We have some training data. Now, how we can use this training data to generate more data based on it. The following image is a screenshot of Cohere's playground. In the following example, we are giving it the intent: Play Music. With that, we are supplying it with a bunch of examples. When we click the generate button, it will generate relevant text."", 'The following image demonstrates another example of using the Cohere playground to generate text. Here, we are feeding it with an intent, for instance, setting an alarm or a reminder.', 'So far, we have seen the ways of increasing the data we have using data augmentation techniques. But, the generated data was similar to the existing data. What if we want to add data diversity? Dr. Tatman divides the approaches to adding diversity into two parts.', 'Prompts Based on Emotions:', 'Prompt Based on Specific User Persona', 'Prompt by Referencing Specific Websites', 'For instance, the above approaches wonâ€™t work very well if our intents are too specific or unique. The provided approaches will work best if your target users are a large chunk of existing social media users. Also, adding that data diversity in the given way does not represent your actual users. It is basically a stopgap that gives us a warmer start.', 'Itâ€™s recommended to do hand validations in the first pass. She asks to add a human-in-the-loop for better performance.

When implemented successfully, this type of app could substantially reduce the costs and time associated with customer support training and increase overall staff efficiency. ', 'In this article, weâ€™ll go over the details of this application from frontend to backend, including how this creative team used the Cohere Generate and Cohere Embed endpoints to develop a practical business solution for customer support chatbots.', 'One of the main reasons it takes so long to contact customer support is the extended wait time due to high request volumes from both customers and internal staff. Additionally, because many of these queries relate to specific product information, support agents either need to research the queries manually, undergo continual training to familiarize themselves with inventory products and specifications, orâ€”in many casesâ€”both.', 'The Turing teamâ€™s app aims to solve this issue by providing agents with automated responses to these product-specific questions. This allows agents to reply to customers more rapidly, enabling them to resolve more requests in the same amount of time.', 'The step-by-step process behind this NLP-powered app is relatively simple. First, the app extracts product information from the company website and stores it in a knowledge base as text. It then uses the Cohere Embed and Cohere Generate endpoints to generate questions and answers (Q&As) from that text.', 'Based on input from the customer support chatbot, the tool creates three appropriate responses to the customerâ€™s message. The support agent can either reply using one of the responses as-is, edit one before sending it as a response, or answer the query manually.', 'That is the appâ€™s process in a nutshell. Next, letâ€™s explore each step in more detail, starting with the knowledge base.', 'The app generates a knowledge base by extracting the product description from the companyâ€™s website and creating a vector embedding. It will use this embedding later for comparing the semantic similarity between the knowledge base and the customerâ€™s message.', 'For this project, the developers used information from Two Wests & Elliott, an eCommerce store selling equipment for greenhouses and gardens, to generate the knowledge base. Below is the webpage for the â€œHalls Standard Cold Frameâ€ item, which lists product information, including the price, dimensions, materials, and delivery options.', 'The app includes a prompt instructing the Generate endpoint to create Q&As using the productâ€™s description. It also provides sample Q&As that better enable the model to understand the downstream task.', 'In this example, the app uses the pictured product description to create a prompt with the instruction: â€œGenerate questions from this text.â€ This prompt contains product information and a sampling of Q&As that need to be generated. ', 'From this example, you can see that the app has collected everything it needs to generate responses for the most common types of customer support questions. But how exactly does it do that?', 'The backend of the app consists of two parts. The first uses semantic search to compare the prompt that the customer enters and the existing information in the knowledge base. To do so, it uses Cohere Embed endpoint to capture semantic information about the customerâ€™s query. Cohere returns a list of floating point numbersâ€”called embeddingsâ€”that capture the semantic information about the text. Embeddings are a way to represent the meaning of the text as a list of numbers. ', 'The app also uses Annoyâ€”a Python library used to perform a nearest neighbor search for points in spaceâ€”to build an index that stores the embeddings and searches these using nearest neighbor search.', 'The second part of the tool handles cases where the answer to the customerâ€™s question is not in the knowledge base or when the question is not relevant to the product. To do this, the tool uses the Generate endpoint to provide a reasonable response to the customerâ€™s query.', 'In this example, the customerâ€™s statement has not specified the product for which they need information.', 'In this instance, Cohere Generate returns the following response:', 'While the backend operates in Python, the front-end interfacesâ€”one for the customer and one for the support agentâ€”run using JavaScript.', 'This support agent can access the interface by navigating to {url}/customer-support. Then, they can connect with a customer in the chatbot window to send and receive messages.', 'The code for this connection looks as follows:', 'The customer interface is accessible at the path {url}/customer-chat. The customer initiates a chat with an agent and can send and receive messages when the agent connects.', 'Hereâ€™s the code for connecting at a customerâ€™s address:', 'Now that youâ€™ve thoroughly explored the application, letâ€™s see how all the pieces come together.', 'First, the customer initiates a chat by entering a message into the window prompt. Then, the customer chatbot support agent joins. The customer can then ask for product-specific information by entering their query. The app converts this query into a vector embedding and measures the semantic similarity between the query and the information from the knowledge base.', 'Cohere Embed then returns two potential responses to the query. Cohere Generate also returns a product-nonspecific response as the third automated response.', 'From there, the agent can answer the query using any of these responses. The agent can also choose to edit the automated response before sending it.', 'While NLP is relatively new as a widely available tool, it is already changing how technology and businesses operate. Chat-based customer support systems can benefit substantially from implementing NLP-based functionality. They represent just one of an abundance of NLP applications, and the potential of NLP extends as far as its usersâ€™ aspirations. The developers of the customer support app had just three days to create it, so imagine what you can create with just a little more time. ', 'Moreover, these tools are well within your reach. Cohere brings this technology right to your fingertips, providing access to advanced NLP functionality via an innovative and intuitive platform.Check out Team Turingâ€™s project code or watch their hackathon presentation to learn more about their customer support app powered by Cohere.

Using the artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities of the Cohere Platform and its Generate endpoint, you can create a simple web application that uses keywords in a short phrase to generate multiple product descriptions and automate this repetitive copywriting task. \xa0', 'The Cohere Platform provides access to Cohereâ€™s LLMs through an easy-to-use API and endpoints like Cohere Generate. Cohereâ€™s LLMs have been trained using extensive text-based data from a wide variety of sources. When given a prompt or a phrase as input, the model can use what it has learned to paraphrase or create new content.', 'To build our product description generator using Cohere Generate, we can take either the prompt engineering or the fine-tuning approach. Prompt engineering involves writing inputs in a way that achieves the best generations, while fine-tuning consists of creating a custom model using your dataset, which makes the generated text more adaptable for your use case. In this tutorial, weâ€™ll use the prompt engineering approach.', 'Check out the final project code on Github.', 'To follow this tutorial, ensure you have the following:', 'On the left menu, click API Keys and create a trial API key.

"['Today, weâ€™re thrilled to announce an entirely reimagined platform pricing structure designed to provide more flexibility, control, and value to every developer and business building on the Cohere Platform. Our new pricing opens up the platform to allow you greater access and a simpler experience when choosing the right resources for your project. Youâ€™ll be able to experiment more for free, estimate costs more easily, and see less jargon from us. Read on for the full details!', '1. Weâ€™re providing a brand new free developer tier. Natural language processing (NLP) has become part of the public consciousness due to its rapid evolution and increasing number of applications. We want to make it easier for every developer to explore the vast potential of NLP and experiment with it on the Cohere Platform. So, weâ€™re replacing our current $75 free credit program with a new freemium tier that gives you more hands-on experience with our API.', 'To enable the free tier, weâ€™re introducing two types of API keys that give users access to all of Cohereâ€™s endpoints: Trial API keys and Production API keys. All current API keys will automatically be converted to a Trial API key, which is rate-limited to 100 API calls per minute and cannot be used in production scenarios. If youâ€™re new to Cohere, get your Trial API key by signing up for an account.For developers looking for higher rate limits, or to serve Cohere to users in an application, you can upgrade to a Production API key where the throughput is 100 times higher (10,000 calls per minute). To upgrade your key now, simply complete the â€œGo to Productionâ€ workflow under the Usage tab in your dashboard (it takes less than 3 minutes).We hope that the new free tier will allow you to prototype using Cohere without worrying about having to upgrade in order to complete your experiment or proof of concept.', '2. We heard you, and weâ€™ve simplified our pricing plans. Thanks to your feedback and our relentless focus on improving efficiencies, weâ€™ve simplified our pricing structure to make it easier for you to estimate the costs of using our platform. Weâ€™re also reducing the price of our embeddings (decreased by more than 10x depending on the length of your inputs) to enable and encourage a broader range of applications and tasks to be built with Cohere.

"['Weâ€™ll explore how developers can build the next generation of digital note-taking tools, powered by language AI.', 'The internet has made the world a smaller place and enabled us to collectively produce a massive amount of information. But turning this firehose of raw data into useful knowledge is challenging.', 'Because of this, the topic of Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) has been getting a lot of attention in recent years. It looks into how we can efficiently capture, organize, and ultimately make use of all the information around us.', 'So, itâ€™s not surprising that digital note-taking applications are now proliferating, coming in different shapes and flavors. They allow us to conveniently capture and organize our notes, give us access to them when we need them, easily search for the information we need, or share notes with others. ', 'Having said that, these tools still very much require that users invest a significant amount of time and effort to make them work. But not everyone has the patience and discipline to keep their personal PKM system running.', 'What if we could leverage language AI technology to make the whole experience more frictionless, and even more enjoyable? Imagine fusing language AI into these note-taking tools and taking them to the next level â€” organize, condense, connect, and even create new information. ', 'There exists an opportunity for developers and entrepreneurs to build innovative products that help users get even more out of what they consume.', 'In this article, weâ€™ll focus on one particular PKM use case: how we make sense of our notes. The premise is that, while we typically organize information in files and folders, our brains donâ€™t actually work that way. Our creativity comes from connecting seemingly disconnected ideas, and a folder structure for organizing information does not help us do that. ', 'This is where the graph approach comes in. The idea is to connect information in a network-like fashion rather than in folders, which frees up information instead of having it stuck in compartments.', 'The way of thinking about the graph is analogous to how the world wide web is organized. One web page contains links pointing to other web pages, which in turn contain more links pointing to other web pages. As a websiteâ€™s information expands, its number of pages increases, and eventually they all form a web of information connected via links.', 'The graph works in a similar manner, except now the context is your personal collection of notes. When your notes are connected in this way (instead of being buried somewhere and never to be found again), they become more discoverable. This facilitates the serendipitous generation of ideas from the notes that you have been curating all the while.', 'There are already a number of digital note-taking tools that support the creation of such graphs. But the problem is, as weâ€™ve mentioned earlier, to make it work, users will have to invest a substantial amount of effort to build the links manually over time.', 'What if we could build an AI-assistant that can make these connections automatically? And what if this AI-assistant could also help generate notes and surface new ideas collaboratively with users? ', 'Letâ€™s go through a demo to explore this idea.', 'In this demo, weâ€™ll explore two specific ways that language AI can be used to enhance the experience of using note-taking applications, namely:', 'Large language models (LLM) have been pre-trained with a massive collection of text, which makes them capable of capturing the patterns of how humans use language. The outcome: just by giving them a simple prompt, these models can generate impressively original and coherent text.', 'With the Cohereâ€™s API, this capability is served by the Generate endpoint. Given an input (called a â€œpromptâ€), the endpoint will generate a new stream of text. The purpose of a prompt is to provide a context for the text that we want the model to generate.', 'A basic format that generally works well contains a short description of the overall context followed by a few examples of prompts and completions. Needing just a few examples, it establishes patterns, or â€œtrainingâ€ data, for telling the model of what kind of text to generate next. Read this documentation if you would like to learn more.', 'The Generate endpoint can be applied in many different use cases, and one of them is in extracting information from a piece of text. The key is in the prompt, where we need to show a few examples of a piece of text and the kind of information to extract from the text.', 'Weâ€™ll build an extraction step that takes each note â€” letâ€™s call this the â€œparentâ€ note â€” and suggests parts of that note that can be expanded into its own note. These new â€œchildâ€ notes would then become links and be linked back to the parent note.', 'The prompt weâ€™ll use is as follows. It contains a few examples of a note and the corresponding topics or key concepts within the note.', 'Letâ€™s test it with a couple of short notes, as follows.', 'Software Engineering:', 'Software engineering is a very broad field, but itâ€™s also one of the fastest growing professions in the world. Software engineering is the application of engineering principles to software development.', 'Software engineering is about more than just writing code; itâ€™s about designing and developing software that meets the needs of customers and users. Software engineers are responsible for creating new programs and applications, as well as maintaining and fixing existing ones.', 'Artificial Intelligence:', 'Artificial intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems.', 'Artificial intelligence (AI) is used in many applications today, including voice recognition, self-driving cars, and even some household appliances. AI is also used in video games, where it can control the behavior of non-player characters in order to create more realistic interactions between the player and the game world.', 'We call the Generate endpoint via the co.generate() method to generate the potential links for each of these two notes.', 'We wonâ€™t cover the details here, but if youâ€™d like to understand what the parameters used in this method mean, you can read about them in the API documentation or this blog post.', 'And using our two example notes, the endpoint suggests the following topics:', 'Software Engineering:\nSoftware Development, Software Engineers', 'Artificial Intelligence:\nVideo Games, Non-Player Characters, Realistic Interactions', 'Notice how these suggested topics were taken from the note passage. These then will become new links to be created and linked back to the original note.', 'There are still many ways we can enhance this further. One of them is to add more sophistication to the link suggestions. We used a simple prompt consisting of a few examples of straightforward extractions in this demo. But sometimes we want the model to identify deeper concepts within a text, and thatâ€™s when it needs to see more examples to do its job well. ', 'We can do this by finetuning a model. Finetuning uses a custom dataset to retrain a model, so it can specialize in performing a specific task.

The prompt weâ€™ll use contains a few examples of a topic name and its corresponding note.', 'We call the Generate endpoint, with slight changes to the max_tokens and the temperature parameters (hereâ€™s the documentation again) to generate a new note given a topic.', 'As an example, letâ€™s take one of the suggested topics we got in the previous section: Software Development. Below is the generated note.', 'Software Development:', 'Software development is the process of conceiving, specifying, designing, programming, documenting, testing, and bug fixing involved in creating and maintaining applications, frameworks, or other software components.', 'Software engineering is an engineering branch associated with development of software in a systematic method. The systematic method is known as software development life cycle (SDLC).', 'While this short note is unlikely to be the final version weâ€™d keep, notice that it already contains many concepts and ideas that we could now expand on. So, instead of staring at a blank screen, an AI-assistant is a welcome help in growing a knowledge base.', 'Weâ€™ve now covered the two use cases: building links and generating note ideas. But their benefits will only become evident when there is some scale involved. So, letâ€™s complete this demo with a hypothetical example of growing a knowledge base from scratch and visualizing the resulting graph.', 'Weâ€™ll start by seeding a few initial topics: Computer Science, Software Engineering, Programming, and Artificial Intelligence. We want the model to generate a short note for each of these topics, suggest new links from each note, and then repeat this cycle for a few rounds.', 'Once thatâ€™s done, we may want to visualize the graph of this knowledge base. With Python, we can use libraries such as Pyvis (which is what we are using here).', 'After a few cycles, this is what the graph looks like.', 'Each dot represents a note in which the title is shown. Each connecting line between two notes indicates that one of the notes mentions the other noteâ€™s topic in its contents. And as we traverse the graph, we can trace how one topic relates to another.', 'In the demo, we used the Generate endpoint to help us build a personal knowledge base. We looked at a couple of ways to utilize this endpoint: first, to generate paragraphs of text, and second, to extract links from an existing text.', 'However, there are so many other possible ways to build with this endpoint. For example, you can summarize a long piece of text into a condensed format, rewrite a text to follow a specific tone, build a conversational agent, create a question answering interface, and much more. ', 'And the nice thing is, you donâ€™t have to have a lot of training data to start prototyping with the model â€” just start with a short prompt. This blog post shares a few more ideas of what you can build with this endpoint.', 'To try out the Cohere platform, sign up for an account today!', 'Looking back at the moments that shaped the first six months of C4AI Cohere For AI launched in June of this year as a non-profit research lab and community dedicated to contributing fundamental research in machine learning.

"WordGsr is a cooperative party minigame played on a single device within the Python console. It can be played in either of two modes - the telephone mode, or the point mode. Players take turns inputting words into the program, which then using the Cohere Generate api, outputs a realistic sentence for other players to guess the original words. The telephone version has the players pass their guesses to the next sentence, with the goal of keeping as close to the original words as possible. The point version is similar, except the players choose a new set of words each turn, and other players can earn points by guessing the words correctly. The program begins within the Main.py file, where the player can pick their desired mode. Then, based on their choice, they are directed to either the pointsVer.py or telephoneVer.py file, which runs the game.

It provides a unified typology of harmful content generated within online communities and a comprehensive list of examples, which can be grouped into four types:', 'There are publicly available datasets within the content moderation space which you can experiment with, for example:', '', 'Here we take a quick look at performing a toxicity detection using the Classify endpoint of the Cohere API. In this example, our task is to classify a list of example social media comments as either toxic or benign.', '', 'LLMs work by conditioning it with some examples of what we want its outputs to look like. In our case, we’ll provide a few examples of labeled data, whereby each data point contains the text online comment and the associated toxicity label. Then we feed the model with the inputs we want to classify and the model will return the predicted class it belongs to.', 'We’ll use the Cohere Playground, which is an interface that helps you quickly prototype and experiment with LLMs.', 'First, we choose the model we want to use and enter the labeled examples. The model will work fine with as few as 5 examples per class, but in general, the more data, the better. In this example, we’ll provide 5 examples for each class: toxic and benign.', '', 'Here’s a better look at all ten examples:', 'Next we enter the list of inputs we want to classify and run the classification. Here we have 3 inputs per class, making it 6 total.', '', 'Here’s a better look at all six inputs and outcomes:', 'In this small example, the model got all classifications correct. We can then generate the equivalent code to access the Classify endpoint by exporting the code from the Playground.', '', 'The following is the corresponding code snippet for the API call. From here, we can further build the content moderation solution according to the scale and integration needs.', 'To get the best classification performance, you will likely need to perform custom training, which is a method for customizing an LLM model with your own dataset. This is especially true for a content moderation task, where no two communities are the same and where the nature of the content is always evolving. The model will need to capture the nuances of the content within a given community at a given time, and custom model training is a way to do that.', 'The Cohere platform lets you train a model using a dataset you provide. Refer to this article for a step-by-step guide.', 'In summary, Cohere’s LLM API empowers developers to build content moderation systems at scale without having to worry about building and deploying machine learning models in-house.

Starting from the same Transformer architecture as Google’s Search and Translate, Cohere’s Classify endpoint can analyze and label incoming text (like customer requests) based on a predefined set of relevant categories (like billing, accounts, technical, feature request, or how-to). Behind the scenes are Cohere’s large language models, which developers can further finetune with their own dataset per their business or industry. Here's how it works, set the road rules: Define the issue types relevant to your business. Then, train Classify with examples of customer requests for each of these categories. This helps our model understand the different words and phrases that your customers are using to describe their issues. Start the engine: Classify then uses this knowledge to automatically parse all inbound customer requests (text analysis), determine the specific issue type for each one (text classification), and organize them by issue type (topic labeling). Get driving: Once the classification process is complete, you can use that data to route each request to the team or agent best suited to handle an issue type. Or, improve your auto-responder workflow to offer self-service help options to your customers. Give your customers and team time back in their day.
